## Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Contol (IoC)

Here we will describe both concepts in a few words and describe:

- the architecture we're chosen
- why we implemented it in this way

Also, we need to describe here:

- how to use the DI & IoC
- when to use it and when NOT to use it
- best practices
